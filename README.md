💻 Late-night coding sessions, countless cups of coffee, and tons of debugging... but Alhamdulillah, my first blog website is officially LIVE! 🎉

🚀 Fully responsive, dynamic, and 100% functional — powered by Headless CMS Sanity. After months of hard work, here’s what I’ve implemented:
✅ About Page
✅ Comments Section
✅ Contact Page
…and so much more!

The journey wasn’t easy. From deployment errors to smooth sailing — seeing it all come together was truly worth it! 😎

📈 Excited to continue building, scaling, and learning with Headless CMS, Next.js, and more! This is just the beginning of an exciting adventure in Full-Stack Development. 💪
